Connect this module to your Arduino (or Pi) via I2C for quality FM radio - a building block for a bigger project?

This simple-to-connect FM module delivers a very nice audio experience (as good as FM quality gets, I think) and with the options available via the 5-byte I2C message you can control all sorts of features: mono/stereo, stereo noise reduction, soft mute, full mute, station minimum signal strength to name just a few.

But this is just the beginning.

Using this module as a central part of a bigger project you can add a TFT screen to show the frequency, signal strength, mono/stereo indicator and so on.

And you can use a Rotary Encoder to tune the module up or down the band - or use the in-built searching feature to find those stations for you! You can even tell it how strong the signal must be before it returns the station to you.

You can listen to this module using earphones without further ado. But how about adding an LM386 amplifier module to make it really sound great? Or a much bigger amplifier if you feel up to it!

All in all this simple FM module will teach you about I2C in a very simple way but will also provide you with a central building block of a much bigger project, should you wish to explore TFT (or touch) screens, Rotary Encoders, Push Switches and Audio Amplifiers. A perfect learning opportunity for beginners to the Arduino, ESP8266 or Raspberry Pi world.
